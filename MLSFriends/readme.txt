Copyright (c) 2006 MyLatinSoulmate - <http://www.mylatinsoulmate.com/>   

needs: Xoops version 2.2.x with the profiles module


This module allows your members to:

- add eachother as favorites;
- Send eachother an Interest PM ("I am interested in you");
- view their list of Favorites;
- view who admirers them (who added them to their favorites list).


To Install:

1) Upload the module to your website (I imagine you guessed that part);
2) Upload the imagine in the PM/images/ directory (used for the Interest PM);
3) Install the module the typical way via module administration;
4) Change your "profile_userinfo" template (admin->Misc. tools->templates etc...) with the one included here. This template adds the buttons for "Add as a Favorite" and "Send Interest" to your member profiles;
5) Make the MLSFriends Block visible so people can see the latest 3 admirers.


Enjoy this module and adapt it to suite your personal use.... ah and don't forget to visit my site www.mylatinsoulmate.com (or better link me somewhere in your page ;))


Cheers,


Marc
